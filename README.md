# Stock market strategys

A stock strategy is a plan for buying, selling, and managing stocks, using a set of rules
to make informed decisions and manage risk. Common strategies include the **buy
and hold** method for long-term growth, **day trading** for short-term profits, and **trend 
following**, which involves buying when prices are rising and selling when they start to 
fall. Other strategies focus on specific indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) 
or combine different assets, such as using the Warren Buffett 90/10 rule (90% in an 
S&P 500 index fund and 10% in bonds). A good strategy is objective, quantifiable, and 
adaptable to changing market conditions. 

# Common stock strategies

*    Buy and Hold: A long-term strategy where you buy stocks and hold them for an 
     extended period, believing their value will grow over time.
*    Day Trading: A short-term strategy where you buy and sell securities within the 
     same trading day to profit from small price movements.
*    Trend Following: This strategy involves identifying an emerging trend and buying 
     stocks that are rising, then selling them once the trend shows signs of reversal.
*    Momentum Investing: Focuses on buying stocks that have been performing well 
     recently, with the expectation that they will continue to do so.
*    70/30 RSI Strategy: Uses the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. You buy 
     when the RSI drops below 30 (oversold) and consider selling when it rises above 70 (overbought).
*    Buffett's 90/10 Rule: A diversified strategy with 90% of your money in a low-cost 
     S&P 500 index fund and 10% in short-term government bonds. 

# Key principles for success

*    **Have a clear plan**: A good strategy is a detailed plan based on specific, objective 
     rules, not emotions.
*    **Understand your risk tolerance**: Some strategies, like day trading, are riskier than 
     others, such as buy and hold. Choose a strategy that aligns with your comfort level for risk.
*    **Avoid emotional decisions**: A set strategy helps you avoid impulsive decisions 
     based on fear or greed.
*    **Stay adaptable**: Markets change, so it's crucial to periodically review and adapt 
     your strategy to evolving conditions.
*    **Focus on a few strategies**: It's often best to focus on just a couple of strategies at 
     a time rather than trying to use too many at once
