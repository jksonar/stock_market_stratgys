## ✅ Recommended Multi-Asset Funds (MAAFs)

These tend to give a balanced mix of equity + debt + other assets such as commodities — offering diversification with moderate risk and long-term growth potential. ([Angel One][1])

| Fund                                         | Notes / Strengths                                                                                              |

| **Quant Multi Asset Fund**                   | Among the best 5-year CAGRs (~ > 25–27 %) among MAAFs; good 3-yr returns too. ([MasterTrust][2])               |
| **ICICI Prudential Multi Asset Fund**        | Large AUM (sizeable portfolio), stable performance, decent risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe). ([Angel One][1])    |

## 🔄 Recommended Balanced / Dynamic / Balanced-Advantage Funds (for more active asset-allocation and downside management)

If you prefer a more “dynamic” approach — where the fund manager changes equity/debt exposure based on markets — these 
funds may suit you. ([Scripbox][4])

| Fund                                           | Notes / Strengths                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Nippon India Balanced Advantage Fund**       | A well-known BAF, moderate returns and good for those who prefer lower volatility. ([Scripbox][4])    |
| **Baroda BNP Paribas Balanced Advantage Fund** | Offers dynamic equity-debt allocation; for investors seeking more active rebalancing. ([Scripbox][4]) |
| **Tata Balanced Advantage Fund**               | Lower expense ratio, slightly conservative — could suit moderate-risk investors. ([Scripbox][4])      |
| **Edelweiss Balanced Advantage Fund**          | Balanced performance over years, reasonable for investors wanting a hybrid approach. ([Scripbox][4])  |

**👍 Good for:** Investors concerned about market volatility who prefer a more “protective + opportunistic” fund — equity exposure when markets are favorable, debt or debt + arbitrage when markets are turbulent.

## 🎯 What to pick based on your goals

* If you want **long-term growth + diversification + moderate risk**, go for any of the Multi-Asset funds 
(like Quant, ICICI Pru, Nippon, UTI, SBI).
* If you prefer **some downside protection along with equity exposure** (i.e. you fear volatility), then 
Balanced / Dynamic Funds (like Nippon India BAF, Baroda BNP Paribas BAF, Tata BAF, Edelweiss BAF) could be a better fit.
* If your horizon is **≥ 5 years** and you are okay with moderate ups and downs: Multi-Asset Funds ➡︎ broader 
diversification may work better.
* If you are more cautious and want **less volatility but still decent returns**: Balanced / Dynamic Funds may suit you.
