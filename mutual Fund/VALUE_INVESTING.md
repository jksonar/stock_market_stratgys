If your goal is **a mutual fund that buys stocks at low price and sells them high**, then you are basically looking for funds that follow **value investing** or **dynamically adjust** based on market levels.

Here are the types of mutual funds that do this *by design*:

---

## ✅ **1. Value Funds (Best match for “buy low, sell high”)**

These funds **search for undervalued stocks** and buy them when prices are low.

### ✔ How they work

* Buy stocks that are fundamentally strong but temporarily down.
* Sell when the stock price goes up to fair value.
* Follow Warren Buffett–style investing.

### ✔ Examples (India)

* **ICICI Prudential Value Discovery Fund**
* **Kotak India EQ Contra Fund**
* **Nippon India Value Fund**
* **HDFC Capital Builder Value Fund**

---

## ✅ **2. Contra Funds**

Contra funds invest *against the market trend* — they buy companies that are out of favour (low price).

### ✔ Examples

* **Kotak India EQ Contra Fund**
* **SBI Contra Fund**

---

## ✅ **3. Dynamic Asset Allocation / Balanced Advantage Funds**

These funds increase equity when market is **low** and reduce equity when market is **high**.

### ✔ How they work

* When market crashes → **Buy more equity**
* When market is expensive → **Sell equity**, shift to debt
* Gives smoother returns over time

### ✔ Examples (India)

* **ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund**
* **HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund**
* **Nippon India Balanced Advantage Fund**
* **Aditya Birla Sun Life Balanced Advantage Fund**

These are ideal if you want a fund that **automatically buys low and sells high** without your involvement.

---

## ✅ **4. Multi-Asset Funds**

These move money between:

* Equity
* Gold
* Debt

They naturally rebalance, buying the asset which is low and selling the asset which is high.

## 🏆 **Best category for automatic “buy low, sell high”:**

### ⭐ **Balanced Advantage Funds (BAF)**

### ⭐ **Value Funds**

---
If you want to **invest monthly through SIP** and also do **lump-sum when you get a market opportunity (dip)**, then you should choose a fund category that **automatically buys more when markets fall and books profit when markets rise**.

Below are the **best fund types** for your style:

---

# ✅ **1. Balanced Advantage Fund (Best for SIP + opportunistic lump-sum)**

These funds **automatically buy low and sell high** using dynamic asset allocation.

### ✔ Why they fit your strategy

* You do monthly SIP → fund handles volatility
* Market dips → you can add lump-sum
* Fund automatically increases equity in dips
* Less risky compared to pure equity funds

### ⭐ Best Balanced Advantage Funds (Top picks)

* **ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund**
* **HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund**
* **Nippon India Balanced Advantage Fund**

---

# ✅ **2. Value / Contra Funds (Buy low stocks)**

These funds buy undervalued or out-of-favor stocks, perfect if you want to invest lump-sum during corrections.

### ⭐ Top Funds

* **ICICI Prudential Value Discovery Fund**
* **Kotak India EQ Contra Fund**
* **SBI Contra Fund**

---

# ⭐ Recommended Combo for You

If you want a simple strategy:

### **Monthly SIP → Balanced Advantage Fund**

### **Lump-sum when market dips → Value / Contra Fund**

This gives:

* Stability + automatic buy low/sell high (BAF)
* Extra growth during market dips (Value/Contra)
